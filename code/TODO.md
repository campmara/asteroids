UFO needs to shoot bullets!

Code Cleanup Pass - Collision

User Interface Elements to Implement:
* Start Screen that says "PRESS HYPERSPACE (DOWN / S) TO PLAY"
* Title?
* Player 1 should flash at the top of the screen when the game is started briefly.
* GAME OVER when the game...is over.
* Should we go through the trouble of implementing 3-letter name high score input?

Small Particle Effect!!!

Make the lachlan mouse brothers text sin wave up and down for a fun effect?

Think about implementing math functions for our use here: float abs, cos, sin.

Attract-mode.
