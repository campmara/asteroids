User Interface Elements to Implement:
* Player 1 should flash at the top of the screen when the game is started briefly.
* GAME OVER when the game...is over.
* Should we go through the trouble of implementing 3-letter name high score input?

Make the lachlan mouse brothers text sin wave up and down for a fun effect?

Think about implementing math functions for our use here: float abs, cos, sin.

Code Cleanup Pass

We do need sound...

Two-player mode????

Draw some stars in the background? Just for a little visual flair?

BUGS:
* Discrete collision checking seems to not work 100% of the time, noticed this around the screen boundary, so maybe is has something to do with our collision grid and their north, south, east, west reference structure...
