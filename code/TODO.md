Small Particle Effect!!!

Code Cleanup Pass - Collision

Asteroids spawning logic and level logic.

Asteroids should slowly get faster as the level progresses.


User Interface Elements to Implement:
* Start Screen that says "PRESS HYPERSPACE (DOWN / S) TO PLAY"
* Title?
* Player 1 should flash at the top of the screen when the game is started briefly.
* Score should say "00" at the start.
* Display the number of lives at the top by drawing the player again. Compression?
* GAME OVER when the game...is over.
* Should we go through the trouble of implementing 3-letter name high score input?

Make the lachlan mouse brothers text sin wave up and down for a fun effect?

Think about implementing math functions for our use here: float abs, cos, sin.
