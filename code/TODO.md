# TODO

* There is a bug in the DrawLine code that is causing a buffer overrun still. The asteroid causes it. I think we're missing an edge case.

* Figure out the rotational math to take these local line positions and rotate them around.

* Implement ship movement.
* Make the ship rotate with sideways input.
