Code Cleanup Pass - Collision

Either the player needs a temporary invulnerability after being shot, or we have to respawn the player in an unoccupied grid space (Leaning towards invuln period because that will also be more communicative that you *have* been shot in the first place).

User Interface Elements to Implement:
* Start Screen that says "PRESS HYPERSPACE (DOWN / S) TO PLAY"
* Title?
* Player 1 should flash at the top of the screen when the game is started briefly.
* GAME OVER when the game...is over.
* Should we go through the trouble of implementing 3-letter name high score input?

Do we need a max speed for the asteroids so it doesn't get ridiculous???

UFOs are supposed to disappear after they reach the other side of the screen.

Small Particle Effect!!!

Make the lachlan mouse brothers text sin wave up and down for a fun effect?

Think about implementing math functions for our use here: float abs, cos, sin.

Attract-mode.
