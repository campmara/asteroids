User Interface Elements to Implement:
* Start Screen that says "PRESS HYPERSPACE (DOWN / S) TO PLAY"
* Title?
* Player 1 should flash at the top of the screen when the game is started briefly.
* Score should say "00" at the start.
* Display the number of lives at the top by drawing the player again. Compression?
* GAME OVER when the game...is over.
* Should we go through the trouble of implementing 3-letter name high score input?
