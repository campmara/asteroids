TODO
=======================================================================================================

User Interface Elements to Implement:
* Should we go through the trouble of implementing 3-letter name high score input?

Code Cleanup Pass

We do need sound...

Two-player mode????

Draw some stars in the background? Just for a little visual flair?

BUGS:
* Discrete collision checking seems to not work 100% of the time, noticed this around the screen boundary, so maybe is has something to do with our collision grid and their north, south, east, west reference structure...

Should we do an optimization pass over the math functions?
